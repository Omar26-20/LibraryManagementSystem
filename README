search for the already existing books. In addition, a user can sign-up once
and then Log in to the library anytime through the localhost link.

then it will give you the link to local host which probably 
is localhost: 127.0.0.1 with the port number 5000.

	going to the terminal of the IDE and getting to the directory
	of this project in you computer and then follow the following
	commands:
		export FLASK_APP=main.py
		flask run

2. In the second step once you executed the program, open the
local host link in a browser in which you will get the Login 
and Sign-up page. 

3. Go to sign-up page and sign-up with new credentials once 
you do so successfully then you will be taken to the home page.
